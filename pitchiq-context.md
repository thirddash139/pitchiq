# Pitch IQ — Project Context
*Last updated: Session — domain live, OG image, blank-screen fix, UI cleanup*

## Overview
Football trivia web app, 5 games. Expo/React Native → static web export. Web-first, no App Store.
- **Live:** `pitchiq.games` (was `pitchiq-gamma-hazel.vercel.app` — custom domain now active)
- **GitHub:** `github.com/thirddash139/pitchiq`
- **Deploy:** `cd ~/pitchiq && git add . && git commit -m "msg" && git push` → Vercel auto-rebuilds ~2min
- **Project root:** `~/pitchiq` | **Preview:** `npx expo start --web`
- **LAUNCHED:** June 13, 2026 = Day #1

## The 5 Games
1. **Locker Room** ✅ Live — daily, guess footballer from club teammates
2. **The Grid** 🔜 Next — weekly, 25 players one category (HTML prototype + 5 categories ready in separate chat)
3. **Transfer Window** 🔜 — guess from career clubs
4. **What Year?** 🚫 Parked
5. **One Season Wonder** 🔜 — guess from one season's stats

## Tech Stack
Expo / React Native, `expo-router`. Packages: `react-native-svg`, `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`, `expo-font`, `@vercel/analytics`. Hosting: Vercel (GitHub auto-deploy).

```

## Dataset (`app/data/teammates.json`)
- **83 players**, evolving (reduced from 106 — removed 21 high-risk entries)
- File order = play order. Day #1 = first entry (Anelka), steps down daily.
- **RULE: APPEND new players to END** — keeps existing sequence intact
- **Launch sequence:** Anelka(#1), Džeko(#2), Cannavaro(#3), Crespo(#4), Messi(#5), Ronaldo(#6), Zidane(#7)...
- **To update:** get new JSON from Game 1 chat → `cp ~/Downloads/teammates.json ~/pitchiq/app/data/teammates.json` → commit/push

## Autocomplete Pool (`app/data/players.json`)
- **953 players** — comprehensive name list covering all major leagues + eras
- Merged at runtime with the 203-name puzzle pool (answers + teammates), deduplicated
- Separate from puzzle data — adding names here carries zero risk to puzzle integrity
- To expand: append names to `players.json` and push. No code changes needed.
- `buildNamePool(dataset)` in `locker-room.tsx` handles the merge

## Design System
- Cream bg `#F2EBD9` | green `#1E4D24`/`#2D6A32` | bright green `#4ade80` (win only) | tan `#9C8E6E`/`#B0A48A` | loss bg `#2b2a26`
- **Type (3-level):** Bebas Neue (wordmark/titles/answer/streak), Playfair Display (card titles/prompt), system sans (body)
- **8-point spacing** (multiples of 4/8/16/24/32/48)

## CRITICAL: Font loading on Expo web
`@expo-google-fonts` fails silently on web. Need BOTH: (1) `useFonts` in `_layout.tsx` for native (NO gate — don't block render on font load, causes blank screen on slow devices), (2) `@font-face` in `app/fonts.css` + `import "./fonts.css"` for web.

## Blank Screen Bug — FIXED
Removing `if (!fontsLoaded) return <blank view>` gate from `_layout.tsx` fixed blank screen on other devices. App always renders; fonts load in background. Never gate the render on font loading.

## Home Screen (`index.tsx`)
- Stadium header img + cream overlay `rgba(242,235,217,0.45)`. Wordmark Bebas 52, white+green IQ.
- Cards: Locker Room (green, live) + The Grid (brown, soon). "More Games" pills. No bottom nav.
- No fake status bar (removed). No hardcoded streak on card (removed — will wire to real data with Stats screen).
- `<ScrollView>` with `contentContainerStyle={{justifyContent:"flex-start"}}` — NOT on style prop (invariant error)

## Locker Room (`locker-room.tsx`)
- **Daily index:** `getDailyIndex()` = days since launch (Jun 13 2026) % dataset.length, today=index 0
- **Puzzle number:** `getPuzzleNumber()` = days since launch + 1, shown as "Day #N · Who is the mystery player?"
- 5 ⚽ lives. 3 teammates shown → 4th after 2 wrong → 5th after 4 wrong. Autocomplete opens UPWARD.
- **Teammate cards show: name + club · years** (always visible on revealed cards)
- **`totalGuesses` state** for "Solved in N" (NOT wrongGuesses.length+1 — off-by-one bug, fixed)
- Wrong guesses = red pills (fontSize 13, bordered). Cards: padding 11, gap 12, name fontSize 13, meta fontSize 11 tan.
- **Persistence:** AsyncStorage key `lockerRoomHistory`, `{date: won}` map. Play-streak = consecutive days played. "Already played today" lock on mount.
- **End screens:** Win = green takeover + confetti + Bebas answer + streak + 7-day history + Share + "How They Connect" below fold. Loss = `#2b2a26` muted, no confetti.
- **Share format:** `⚽ Pitch IQ · Locker Room #N` / `⚽⚽⚽⚪⚪ Solved in 3 · 🔥 5` / CTA / `pitchiq.games`. Uses navigator.share or clipboard.
- **Animations:** lives shake + cards slide-in, both `useNativeDriver: false` (web compat).
- **Nav:** back arrow + "Back to Games" both `router.replace("/")` (not back()).

## Open Graph (`app/+html.tsx` + `public/og-image.png`)
- `app/+html.tsx` is Expo Router's HTML shell — where all `<head>` meta tags live
- OG image: 1200×630 PNG, floodlit pitch design, live at `pitchiq.games/og-image.png`
- Meta tags set: `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:site_name`, `twitter:card`, `twitter:image`
- Description: "Daily football puzzle games. Guess the footballer, master the grid, and more — a new challenge every day."
- Verified working via opengraph.xyz — image shows correctly on Facebook, X, WhatsApp, Discord

## Domain
- Custom domain: `pitchiq.games` (purchased, pointed to Vercel via nameservers)
- Old Vercel URL (`pitchiq-gamma-hazel.vercel.app`) still works but `pitchiq.games` is canonical
- DNS setup: update nameservers at registrar to Vercel's NS → propagates in ~30min

## Vercel (`vercel.json` at ROOT)
```json
{"buildCommand":"npx expo export --platform web","outputDirectory":"dist","framework":null,"cleanUrls":true,"trailingSlash":false}
```

## Scroll Architecture
`fonts.css`: `html,body{overflow:hidden}` + `#root{overflow:hidden;display:flex;height:100%}` kills mobile double-scroll. **Lesson:** justifyContent on ScrollView goes in `contentContainerStyle`, not `style`.

## Analytics
Vercel Web Analytics enabled. `<Analytics/>` in `_layout.tsx`. Dashboard: vercel.com → pitchiq → Analytics. Tracks visitors/page views/return rate. Custom events (puzzle completion, shares) = future work.

## Working Principles (CLAUDE.md)
Think before coding. Simplicity first. Surgical changes. Goal-driven (verifiable success criteria).

## Next Steps
1. **The Grid (Game 2)** — highest leverage move; HTML prototype + 5 categories ready in separate chat
2. **Stats screen** — use existing streak/history data; then re-add bottom nav
3. **Archive** — replay past puzzles (strong retention mechanic, moved up after competitor analysis)
4. **Feedback section** — lightweight player idea collection (Google Form or mailto link)
5. **Buy Me a Coffee** — Ko-fi or similar donation link
6. **Custom analytics events** — track puzzle completion + share rate
7. **Polish:** help/rules screen (? button), skip option, real streak on home card
8. **Unify visual language** — photo header vs illustrated cards (deferred)

## Dev Tips
- Reset puzzle: console `localStorage.clear()` + refresh. On phone: incognito tab.
- New terminal opens in `~` — always `cd ~/pitchiq` first.

## Document System
Three files maintained across Claude Project + VS Code repo:
- `pitchiq-context.md` — this file: app-wide tech + design system
- `Game 1 - Locker Room.md` — Locker Room design decisions + roadmap
- Future: `Game 2 - The Grid.md` etc. as each game launches
